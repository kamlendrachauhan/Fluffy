/*
 * ============Introduction============
 * We assume data is in bytes format so that we can handle any type of data 
 * (images, text or anything else).
 *
 * File should be split into 1MB chunks. Each chunk should have sequenceID 
 * starting from 1. (0 is reserved for MetaData chunk). It should be transfered 
 * to the cluster using protobuf as CommandMessages.
 * 
 * Chunk should be saved along with sequenceID. If user requests for data, we
 * need to asynchronously send the data chunks with sequenceIDs. Client program 
 * will sort chunks and create file from those chunks. 
 * 
 * Data will be stored as key value pairs. Key can be provided by user as well. 
 * For storing on server, we need to use <key>_<sequenceID> to store data.
 * 
 */
/*
 * ============Data Operations============
 * There are 4 types of operations which can be performed on data. They are 
 * analogous to CRUD operations in databases.

/*
 * ============Metadata============ 
 * This class is for storing metadata. We
 * should store sequence size so that we can successfully reconstruct
 * complete file/data from chunks. (Basically, we should know when we should
 * write chunks to the file and so we should know what is the sequence
 * size).
 *
 * So, for example, if a file has 8 chunks of data. seq_size should be 8 +
 * 1. (1 for metadata chunk).
 *
 * size attribute is for storing file size in bytes. (optional) time will
 * store creation time. (optional)
 *
 * Metadata chunk should be created by client program. To create it, client
 * should first identify file size and how many chunks will be created from
 * the file.
 *
 * Metadata should be stored as sequenceNo 0.
